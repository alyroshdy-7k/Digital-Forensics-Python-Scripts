What it basically does:

Uses Python’s glob library to automatically find the correct CSV files (like Installed Programs, USB Device Attached, Run Programs, etc.)
I don’t manually look for filenames,the library does that whole process

Uses the csv library to read each CSV and turn every row into a dictionary.
This means I don’t manually parse any data, the library handles the whole reading process.


What the script extracts:

Installed applications (first 10 entries)

User accounts, by detecting the login name column automatically

Registry hives (checks if SAM, SOFTWARE, and SYSTEM files exist in the folder)

USB history from Autopsy’s USB CSV export

Command/ Running Programs history (first 10 entries)
